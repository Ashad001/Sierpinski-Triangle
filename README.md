# Sierpinski-Triangle
The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal pattern that is named after the Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski. The pattern is made up of equilateral triangles that are recursively subdivided into smaller triangles.

The Triangle is also a popular subject in mathematics. It is often used to introduce concepts such as recursion and self-similarity, and can be generated using a variety of programming languages and software tools. The Triangle has a variety of practical applications in fields such as computer graphics, image compression, signal compression. The fractal nature of the pattern allows it to be used to generate complex shapes, designs and textures, and it has been used in the design of computer-generated landscapes, textures, and other visual effects. (You probably have seen the music colored screen saver while playing music in early 2010s)

## Working Of Code
I made it using turtle library in python which is very popular among beginners in computer graphics. 
I took 3 initial points for triangles and iteratively and randomly calculating midpoint of any 2 point (any original point and any point generated) and displaying this point on screen, plus had to append to previously collected points. I also made the speed function which decides the speed of the process as you move forward

This is what I got after 10000 iterations
